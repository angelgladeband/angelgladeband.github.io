<h1>About Our Band</h1>
<p>ANGELꓱꓷꓯꓶꓨ was conceived in 2019 by me, Reggie C, when I wanted to write music but had no self-discipline. 
<br>It wasn't until 2022 that we actually released music though. I still lack self-discipline, but at least we have music now.</p>

<h2>The People:</h2>

<h3>Reggie Curtis!</h3>

<p>I am currently the only member of the band. 
<br>I hope to invest in more musicians in the future.</p>

<h2/>The Music:</h2>
<p>I get bored playing and listening to the same genre of music so we try to mix it up as much as possible.
<br>I'd like to think that all the songs come together in a nice cohesive way, anyway. Emphasis on "I'd like to think"...</p>
